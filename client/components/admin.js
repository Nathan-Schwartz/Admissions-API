//   Would this page just show data visualizations for reinterviews, acceptance rates, etc

// TODO: Figure out which data visualizations we should do
//   Acceptance rate
//   Soft reject timeline distribution
//   How far do people get?
//   Acceptance rate by fellow
//   How many people who get soft rejected are re-applying
//   Are people who get hard-rejected trying to sneak in?
// TODO: Are we going to be tracking IP addresses of people who are hard rejected in order 
//        to identify people who are trying to fill up our interview slots?
